    title: Good design solves problems
    teaser:
        - This article talks about using ARIA labels as a way to add context to visual assumptions applied to an election results table. A few attributes on elements that rely on color to add meaning solves a problem of presenting visual data to an audience that is visually impaired.

      - Good design is about solving problems, regardless of the medium. American architect, Bertrand Goldberg, designed the Marina City in 1959 to address what he believed to be an issue with Chicago residents leaving the city to live in the suburbs. He came up with a futuristic concept to build a self-contained "city within a city" that contained offices, apartments, a gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, several stores and restaurants, and a marina. Not only did Goldberg come up with a unique visual design, but he also found a way to make life's luxuries and amenities more accessible.
      - Although not directly related, web designers also have problems that they need to try and solve. For example, how does one effectively tell the story of South Carolina's 5th District special election at 8 PM on a Tuesday while US fighter jets are shooting down drones in Syria and a Russian fighter jet flies within five feet of a US Air Force spy plane?

      - "The image above shows CNN's race result module for that exact scenario. Its purpose is to provide details about the race, and above all else, tell the audience who won. Aesthetics aside, the designer has done his job. When I look at the module, even before reading anyone's name, I know that a Republican has won, then I process that his name is Ralph Norman. More detail is available to me: the number of votes Ralph received and what percentage of all voters support him. I'm able to do this quickly because I bring a lot of outside context with me. First, I know that \"R\" stands for \"Republican,\" and that the blue represents Democrats. The module represents the result of an election, and elections have winners. Therefore, I can safely assume that the check icon denotes who won. All of these clues are things that I can visually perceive, but what about people who can't see? What context clues are available and how does someone make sense of color when color doesn't mean anything?"

        quote: What context clues are available and how does someone make sense of color when color doesn't mean anything?
      - Before answering that question, I need to know how somebody would get this information if they can't see it; they would most likely use a screen reader. Without any special consideration, a screen reader would look at this piece of information and announce the text. "Are Ralph Norman. Forty-five thousand, seventy-six. Fifty-one percent. Dee Archie Parnell. Forty-two&hellip;"
      - Unless it's specified, the computer doesn't know that a red checkmark next to a candidate's name means that candidate won, or that a blue D implies that the candidate is a Democrat. If design solves a problem, this design has failed.
      - Situations like this occur all over the Web. Visually, things make sense because designers have studied how to use text, color, shapes, and spacing to deliver a message. They rely on the brain's ability to recognize patterns and previous exposure to symbolism and relationships. ARIA attributes exist to explain all these subconscious assumptions programmatically without sacrificing the designers intent. However, that doesn't mean they can be used to make up for bad design or haphazard markup. ARIA attributes are expected to supplement semantic markup and enhance the tags that HTML provides natively.
      - Assuming that the markup is the best it could be, the image below shows what attributes could be added to CNN's module to enhance the audio output, thus executing the designer's vision and solving the design problem for all audiences.

      - Screen readers will now say, "Republican, Ralph Norman wins! Forty-five thousand, seventy-six votes. Fifty-one percent. Democrat, Archie Parnel. Forty-two&hellip;"
